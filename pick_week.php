                What started as a promising career saw an abrupt halt when Vivek Oberoi called upon THAT infamous press conference and dared to talk about his then-girlfriend's ex-boyfriend, Salman Khan.
                Soon after that, Vivek's career went downhill. 
                But it wasn't just Salman who can be blamed for that downward spiral; Vivek's subsequent choice of films (Kaal, Pyare Mohan, Naksha and many others) definitely added momentum to the same.

               In a recent interview with Mumbai Mirror, Vivek recounts that phase from his life.
                "It was like a fatwa was issued against me from the powers that be."
                The man he refers to in this statement is Salman Khan. 
                In the infamous press conference, Vivek had made a lot of allegations against Salman which included a drunk Bhai harassing Vivek over the phone. His then-girlfriend, Aishwarya Rai, never went on record about the episode and shortly after, there were reports that the two had broken up.
                “When my personal life got messed up, I couldn’t keep my eye on the ball.”

               The positive response to Amazon Prime's Inside Edge and appreciation for his role in the Tamil film, Vivegam, has brought Vivek back on the map. His philanthropic activities have consistently been applauded and it looks like Vivek is ready to come back on the big screen in a big way.
